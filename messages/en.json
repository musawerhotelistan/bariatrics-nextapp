      "faq_1":"How does weight-loss surgery change a patient’s quality of life?",
      "faq_ans":"Firstly; the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and having a heart attack significantly reduces. Secondly; respiratory problems improve after a few months following surgery. Furthermore, the patient can continue to engage in physical activities that he/she had to discontinue due to obesity. Additionally; the symptoms of acid reflux-stomach acid that travels up towards the throat through the esophagus reduces. Finally, high blood sugar is kept under control.",
      "faq_2":"How many bariatric surgeries has Ceyhun Aydoğan performed before?",
      "faq_ans_2":"To date, Dr. Ceyhun and his medical team have successfully performed over 12000 surgeries, without experiencing any complications. Additionally, the surgical mortality rates are ‘zero’. This is mainly due to his surgical experience and efforts to provide patients with the best services through the utilisation of state-of-the-art technologies.",
      "faq_3":"Is metabolic surgery the same as bariatric surgery?",
      "faq_ans_3":"Bariatric surgery encompasses metabolic surgery. Bariatric surgery is for all patients with a very high weight who need weight loss surgery. What we’re finding out is that there are many mechanisms, hormonal and otherwise, that allow patients to lose weight when you change the anatomy of the stomach. Some of them affect the way that your brain senses fullness or satiety. Some of it directly affects your pancreas and the way insulin works on your system to manage blood glucose. All of these types of hormonal effects lead to resolution of many medical problems, whether it’s diabetes or hypertension or metabolic syndrome and that’s where we use the term metabolic surgery.",
      "faq_4":"Can I discontinue some of my medications after bariatric surgery?",
      "faq_ans_4":"With weight-loss you may be able to discontinue or reduce the dosage of many of the medications you take for obesity-associated comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, blood pressure, lipid abnormalities, heart disease and arthritis. If you have a gastric bypass or transit bipartition surgery, you may even be able to discontinue using or to reduce the dosage of your diabetes medications in the early period following bariatric surgery.",
      "faq_5":"What dietary changes will I need to make after surgery?",
      "faq_ans_5":"Successful weight loss surgery, whether it’s gastric sleeve or a gastric bypass, requires following necessary dietary changes before and after the surgery. Prior to the procedure our patients meet with our registered dietitians to understand the eating habit adjustments that need to be made and to receive dietary guidance. Typically, post-surgery, there is a liquid diet that lasts for 10 days, followed by a 20 day soft diet, and regular diet resumption after 1 month. The patient’s personal diet plan will be determined during their consultation with our dietitian.",
      "faq_6":"Who is a good candidate for a gastric balloon?",
      "faq_ans_6":"Gastric balloon is a recommended obesity treatment if you have tried and failed to lose weight by diets and exercise and have a BMI between 30-35, and one or more of the obesity-related comorbidities. In some cases, patients may be eligible for this treatment with a BMI as low as 27. We do not recommend stomach balloons for morbidly obese (BMI > 40), and super-obese (BMI > 50) patients.",
      "faq_7":"Can the gastric bypass surgery be reversed?",
      "faq_ans_7":"It is possible to reverse the surgery, but it is not advised. Reversing the surgery is considered another major procedure and you are at an increased risk for complications. Reversing the surgery also would increase your risk of regaining the weight you have lost.",

      "feedback_1": "What can I say? An amazing experience which has been life changing. I only wish I had done this before. From my surgeon to my follow-up team Selvi, Doga and Muhammed, my experience was brilliant. I have had no complications, no pain. Dr. Aydoghan is a very skilled and talented Surgeon and my follow-ups have always been there for me with advice and support. I would do this all again in the same place with the same people, with no hesitation as this has.",
      "feedback_2": "Truly amazing service from start to finish, transfers to and from airport to clinic and hotel. Clinic was spotless and the staff were so friendly. There was even a nurse stationed in the hotel if you needed anything at all. The aftercare is fantastic with access to doctors for any problems (not that I had any), and regular contact with Selvi and Doga (dieticians) through whatsapp. I would definitely recommend Dr’s Ceyhun Aydoğan, and Muhammed, and their team.",
      "feedback_3": "The group that watches over me includes Dr. Muhammed, Dietitian Selvi and Dietitian Doğa. They have been so amazing in this journey. I got my surgery on 19/03/24 and since I left Istanbul, they’ve always been there to answer all my questions and have always been there to check in on me. I’m very satisfied with and grateful to my team for all their hard work and attentiveness. Their professionalism is exceptional and the overall process was stress-free. I have had no concerns with the process, and really loved the tests they had us do to check we were fit for surgery.",
      "feedback_4": "It’s been nearly a year now since my gastric sleeve operation. All well and I feel happy, healthy and light. Big thank you to the medical team looking after me, Dr. Ceyhun Aydogan, who operated on me. Also thanks to Dr. Mohammed, dietitian Selvi, they look after me after the operation all year round. Would highly recommend this clinic and team.",
      "feedback_5": "I am almost 7 months post surgery with Dr Ceyhun Aydogan. I still have support from dietician Selvi Nur. Which I am grateful for. I have lost 34kg so far and I am looking forward to the rest of my gastric sleeve weight loss journey. I have been recommending Arpanu Medical to everyone. My partner also had this surgery done after me and my friend is going in two weeks, so we are all Dr Ceyhun Aydogan's patients. No regrets.",
      "feedback_6": "I wanted to thank everyone who was part of my gastric sleeve surgery. Starting from Prof. Dr. Ceyhun Aydogan, very professional, his assistants, anesthetists, nurses, ward nurses and hotel nurses, dieticians, to my translator Marcos, a really smart guy, they were exceptional. But a great thanks goes to the person who accompanied me throughout the entire journey, from the first day I contacted her, Lena, one of the secretaries, always available at any time.",
      "feedback_7": "Great staff, Dr Muhammed and dietitian Shelvi follow up my process even after 11 months post op I can ask anything and they are happy to help.",
      "feedback_8": "Dr Aydogan and his team have been amazing throughout my weight loss journey. The support I have received has enabled me to make the most of my surgery and use it to its greatest potential. I am six months post op and have lost 44kg. My starting weight was 140kg. The care continues via the whatsapp team of dieticians and Drs who monitor my progress. If you are considering weight loss surgery then sign up with Dr Aydogan I promise you will have no regrets.",
      "feedback_9": "My experience with Dr. Ceyhun and his team was great. I had my surgery (gastric sleeve) on 8th May and they looked after me with great care. All the nurses are great, even if they don’t speak English. They’ve always been there for me and nothing was too much for them. My coordinator, Robert, who spoke very good English, was great also. He talked to me before the surgery, he answered all my questions and he made me feel at ease.",
